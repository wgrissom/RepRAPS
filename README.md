Reproducible Ratio-Adjustable Power Splitters for Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission

Parallel transmission (pTx) with an array of radiofrequency (RF) coils enables spatially uniform excitation and lower SAR in 7T MRI. 
Currently, high-field scanners have a limited number of transmit channels despit their ability to improve performance. 
Array-compressed pTx (acpTx) networks comprised of unequal power splitters lowers the cost and complexity of multiple transmit channels by
allowing fewer channels to drive more coils. The designs (.brd files) for 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 power splitters are held in this repository. 
The desisngs can be cascaded to be combined in multiple stages for a wider variety of output ratios and an increase in output ports. The designs are
optimized to a small size and tuned to low-loss at 298 MHz.
